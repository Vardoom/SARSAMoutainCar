# SARSAMoutainCar

This project implements the SARSA with RBF function method for the Mountain Car (Gym-OpenAI) environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
The following Python libraries are needed:
* matplotlib.pyplot
* gym
* numpy
* random
* math

### Installing

In order to get the simulation running, please type the following in your terminal.

```
python SarsaMountainCar.py
```

Normally, you should have the results copied in the output folder.

## Running the tests

If you want a graphic output, you can un-comment the “env.render()“ option in the python file.
Be aware that this option slows the process A LOT.
